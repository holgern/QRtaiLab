Introduction
============

QRtailab uses qmake to build all its components .
qmake is part of a Qt distribution.

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro".
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

qrtailab.config is read by all project files of the Qwt package.
So the first step is to edit qwtconfig.pri to adjust it to your
needs.
